Q1: Why might we consider using Git?
Answer: Git is useful because it allows you to save your work both locally 
and on a central server. It also makes collaboration easier by tracking
changes and providing tools, such as merging, to integrate updates from
multiple people efficiently.
Q2: What field could data science be applied to? Give an Example.
Answer: I think data science could be applied to many fields, but one that
could really benefit is marketing. Since marketing is driven by what people
are most likely to buy, data science models and predictions could really 
impact marketing desicision and even sales. Running experiments on what is 
most liekly to sell a product (such as where to run an add or what audience
to target) is a prime example.
